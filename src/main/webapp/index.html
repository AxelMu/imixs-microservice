				<h1>Welcome to Imixs-Workflow</h1>
				<p>
					Imixs-Workflow is an open source workflow engine for human-centric
					business process management (BPM). Human-centric BPM means to
					support human skills and activities by a task orientated
					workflow-engine. The Imixs-Microservice project provides the
					Imixs-Workflow engine as a web-service to be embedded in any
					microservice architecture. <a
						href="http://www.imixs.org/doc/restapi/index.html">Details
						about the Imixs-Rest API can be found here</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>How to Setup</h2>
				<p>
					Imixs-Workflow is based on the Java EE specification and can be
					deplyoed into any Java EE complient application server. See the <a
						href="http://www.imixs.org/doc/deployment/index.html"
						target="_blank">deployment guide</a> for further information.
				</p>
				<h3>Docker</h3>
				<p>
					Alternatively you can run Imixs-Workflow in a Docker container. See
					the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/imixs/workflow/"
						target="_blank">Imixs Docker Project</a> for further information.
				</p>
				<h3>Initalize User DB</h3>
				<p>
					After the first deployment you should initialize the internal
					UserDB. There for first call the setup URL <a
						href="http://localhost/imixs-microservice/setup" target="_blank"
						class="sample-url">http://[YOURSERVER]/imixs-microservice/setup</a>

					This call will intialze the default user 'admin' with the default
					password 'adminadmin'. You can add additional accounts or can
					change the default account later using the 'User-REST service'
					interface.
				</p>

				<h3>How to Deploy a BPMN Model</h3>
				<p>
					After you have setup the Imixs-Workfow Microservice you can deploy
					a workflow Model. A workflow model can be created using the <a
						href="http://www.imixs.org/doc/modelling/index.html"
						target="_blank">Imixs-BPMN eclipse Plugin</a>. A workflow Model
					can be deployed into the Imixs-Workflow using the 'Model-REST
					service' interface. You can deploy the default 'Ticket Workflow'
					using the curl command: <br />

				</p>
				<pre>curl --user admin:adminadmin --request POST -Tticket.bpmn http://localhost:8080/imixs-microservice/model/bpmn</pre>
				<p>You will find the example model in the Imixs-Microservice
					project located at: /src/main/resources/ticket.bpmn</p>


				<h3>Verify Model</h3>

				<p>
					To verify if the model was deployed successfully you can check the
					deployed model version with the Rest API: <a href="./model"
						target="_blank" class="sample-url">http://[YOURSERVER]/imixs-microservice/model</a>
					<br /> If no model version is yet deployed, you can create and
					upload a new BPMN Model using the <a
						href="http://www.imixs.org/modeler/" target="_blank">Imixs-BPMN-Modeller</a>.


				</p>

				<h2>How to Manage a Process Instance</h2>
				The following section includes some short examples how to create,
				process and verify a workflow instance managed by the Imxis-Workflow
				Microservicve. See the <a href="http://www.imixs.org">Imixs-Workflow
					Project</a> for more information.

				<h3>Open the Task List</h3>

				<p>
					Each user involved in a business process has a personal task list
					(called the 'worklist'). You can request the task list for the
					current user by the following Rest API URL: <br /> <a
						href="./workflow/worklist" target="_blank" class="sample-url">http://[YOURSERVER]/rest-service/workflow/worklist</a>
					<br /> The result will include all workitems for the current user.
				</p>

				<h3>Create a new Process Instance</h3>

				<p>To create a new process instance you can POST a JSON Object
					to the Imixs-Microservice in the following way</p>
				<pre>
POST = http://localhost/workflow/rest-service/workflow/workitem
				</pre>


				<p>To create a valid workitem the following attributes are
					mandatory:</p>
				<ul>

					<li>$modelversion = the version of your model</li>
					<li>$processid = the start process</li>
					<li>$activityid = the activity to be processed</li>
				</ul>
				<p>See the following Example:</p>
				<pre>
 {"item":[
     {"name":"$modelversion","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"my-model-definition-0.0.2"}},
     {"name":"$processid","value":{"@type":"xs:int","$":"2000"}}, 
     {"name":"$activityid","value":{"@type":"xs:int","$":"1"}}, 
     {"name":"_subject","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"Some usefull data.."}}
   ]}  
</pre>

				<p>Once you created a new process instance based on a predefined
					model you got a set of data back form the workflow engine
					describing the state of your new business object which is now
					controlled by the workflow engine. This is called the workitem:</p>
				<pre>
{"item":[
   {"name":"$uniqueid","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"141cb98aecc-18544f1b"}},
   {"name":"$modelversion","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"my-model-definition-0.0.2"}},
   {"name":"$processid","value":{"@type":"xs:int","$":"2000"}},
   {"name":"namcreator","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"admin"}}, 
   {"name":"namcurrenteditor","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"admin"}}, 
   {"name":"namowner","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"admin"}}, 
   {"name":"$isauthor","value":{"@type":"xs:boolean","$":"true"}},
   {"name":"_subject","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"JUnit Test-6476"}}, 
   {"name":"txtworkflowstatus","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"Vorlauf"}}, 
   {"name":"txtworkflowresultmessage","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":""}}
  ]}
</pre>
				<p>The workitem includes the attribute '$uniqueid' wich is used
					ot identify the process instance later. Also workflow information
					like the current status or the owner is returend by the service.</p>
				<p>There are serveral Resouce URIs to request the state of a
					process instance. Using the $uniqueid returned by the POST method
					you can request the current status of a single process instance:</p>
				<pre>
GET = http://localhost/workflow/rest-service/workflow/workitem/[UNIQUEID].json
</pre>


				<p>To change the status of a process instance you simply need ot
					post uniqueid together with the next workflow activity defined by
					your workflow model</p>


				<pre>
POST = http://localhost/workflow/rest-service/workflow/workitem/[UNIQUEID]
</pre>
				<pre>
 {"item":[
     {"name":"$uniqueid","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"141cb98aecc-18544f1b"}},
     {"name":"$activityid","value":{"@type":"xs:int","$":"1"}}, 
     {"name":"_subject","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"Some usefull data.."}}
     {"name":"_customdata","value":{"@type":"xs:string","$":"Some more data.."}}
   ]}  
</pre>

				<p>Within the object you can define any kind of data to be
					stored together with the process instance.</p>




				<h2>JUnit Tests</h2>
				<p>The Imixs-Microservice project provide a set of JUnit Tests.
					These tests can be used also as a starting point to see how the
					RestService API works.</p>
