# imixs-microservice
The Imixs-Microservice project encapsulates the Imixs-Workflow Engine into a microservice architecture. This service can be bound to any business application, independent from the technology behind. This allows you to change the business logic without changing a single line of your code. You can control the state of your business process based on a workflow model. Imixs-Microservice sends notifications, logs business transactions and secures your business data.

Imixs-Microservice provides an easy to use REST API. Once deployed you can define your workflow Model within the Eclipse based Imixs-Workflow-Modelling Tool. Through the WebService interface you can create and access process instances through the JSON and XML based WebService inferface.

 
## Installation
Imixs-Microservice can be deployed on a JEE6 Web Server like GlassFish or JBoss/Wildfly.
